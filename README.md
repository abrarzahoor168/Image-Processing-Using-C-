# Image-Processing-Using-Cpp
Image processing is a method or technique to convert an image into digital
form and execute some operations on it, in order to acquire an enhanced image
or to extract some useful information from it. Image processing also can be
described as a processing of images using mathematical operations for which
the input is an image such as a photograph while the output of image pro-
cessing may be either an image or a set of characteristics related to the image.
This Project allows users to upload an Image(BMP) and Perform various Operations on it and Successfully generate the Output Image.
